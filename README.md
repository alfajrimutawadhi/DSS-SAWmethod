## Decision Support System (DSS) with Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method

### What is Decision Support System ?
Decision support system (DSS) is a computerized program used to support determinations, judgments, and courses of action in an organization or a business. A DSS sifts through and analyzes massive amounts of data, compiling comprehensive information that can be used to solve problems and in decision-making. The SAW method is also known as the weighted addition method. The basic concept of the SAW method is to find the weighted sum of the performance ratings for each alternative on all attributes (Fishburn, 1967)(MacCrimmon, 1968). The SAW method needs to process a decision matrix that is normalized to a scale that can be compared with all available alternative ratings.
